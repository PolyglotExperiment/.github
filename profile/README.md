# Polyglot Experiment

-->
This experiment is a integralÂ component of academic research that seeks to obtain insights on the use of a polyglot persistence API created on [Esfinge Query Builder](https://esfinge.sourceforge.net/Query%20Builder.html).

## Prerequisites
- Proficiency in programming with Java 11 or higher and familiarity with annotations.

## Background

## Procedure <sup>(for the supervisor)</sup>
Four tasks are provided: **Simple1A**, **Simple2B**, **Polyglot1A**, and **Polyglot2B**. It involves domains: 1 and 2, with the application of two techniques: simple and polyglot, solved by two groups: A and B.

This experiment employs a crossover methodology. To validate the methodology, the experiment must be executed as outlined below:

- Division of the volunteer cohort into two groups: **A** and **B**;
- Group **A** will perform the tasks **Simple1A** and **Polyglot2A** in that order;
- Group **B** will perform the tasks **Polyglot1B** and **Simple2B** in that order.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The division into groups and the sequence of task execution is essential.
> 
> Additionally, please take into account a time interval between the execution of tasks, if feasible.
