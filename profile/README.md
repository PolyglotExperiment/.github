-->
This experiment is a integral¬†component of academic research that seeks to obtain insights on the use of a polyglot persistence API created on [Esfinge Query Builder](https://github.com/EsfingeFramework/querybuilder/blob/master/documentation/README.md).

## A) Prerequisites üåå
- Proficiency in programming with Java 11 or higher and familiarity with annotations.
- Knowledge with DAO and ORM design patterns is helpful.

## B) Settings ‚öôÔ∏è
The experiment consists of Java projects for which the volunteer must develop what is requested in each one. In this section, it is important to understand what needs to be defined in your development environment.
The Java projects in this experiment are projects configured with Maven. This drastically reduces any incompatibility that may occur. If you already have a Java environment set up, no changes will probably be necessary.

### JDK
The Java projects in this experiment require you to have at least JDK 11 or higher installed. You can download the version specific to your operating system here [https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)

### IDE
The entire experiment was tested using the IDEs [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html) and [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/) on the Windows 10 and 11 and Linux Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS operating systems. Don't worry if your IDE or operating system is different. You will hardly have any problems running the projects in any IDE that supports Java development. Some IDEs that can be used:

- [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html) 
- [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/)
- [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/)

### Firewall
The Java projects in this experiment access the remote servers _mongodb.cemaden.gov.br_ externally on ports _5432_ and _27017_. If prompted, allow your IDE or Java process to also access this.

## C) Background üìñ
In this experiment, tasks will be proposed in Java projects that make use of the Esfinge Query Builder framework. However, prior experience or very specific knowledge about this framework is not required. If you wish, you can learn about this framework [by clicking here](https://github.com/EsfingeFramework/querybuilder/blob/master/documentation/README.md). The background of this experiment is associated with the challenges of polyglot persistence in the same application domain. In this way, to facilitate the general understanding of all the necessary background, a complete application example will be presented here. The idea is to show everything you need to understand to perform the tasks that will be proposed later.

### C1) Exemplification
Imagine that the application domain is Website Sales Marketing Management. Suppose you have users registered in a PostgreSQL relational database and records of visits to product pages stored in a MongoDB NoSQL database. Consider that the user has given consent for the recording of their activities on the site. Notice that the data from the two distinct databases belong to the same domain. The idea is to be able to correlate this data in order to obtain information about, for example, **Which page is most viewed by users over 30 years old?**, this knowledge is useful for relevant and targeted advertisements.

Let's consider that the **User** table is mapped using [JPA (Java Persistence API)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/persistence-jsp.html), as follows.

``` Java
@Entity
@PersistenceType(value = JPA1)
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;
    private String name;
    private String lastName;
    private Strig login;
    private String password;
    private int age;
    // getters and setters
}
```

Let's also consider that the Visit collection is mapped using [Morphia ODM](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/morphia), as follows.

``` Java
@Entity
@PersistenceType(value = MongoDB)
public class Visit {
    @Id
    private ObjectId id;
    private Stringr client;
    private String page;
    private LocalDateTime datehour;
    // getters and setters
}
```

We will initially use the Esfinge Query Builder to provide access to these databases. Esfinge Query Builder offers a solution for creating a persistence layer simply and quickly. Using the philosophy "for a good framework, the method name is enough", Query Builder uses the method names of an interface to infer the queries that need to be executed on the database. The first step is to define an interface with the method names for the queries that need to be made. Optionally, when you want CRUD operations to be available, you can extend the Repository interface.

``` Java
public interface UserDAO extends Repository<User> {
    List<User> getUserByName(String name);
    List<User> getUserByLastName(String lastname);
    List<User> getUserByLogin(String login);
    List<User> getUserByAgeGreater(Integer age);
}
```

``` Java
public interface VisitDAO extends Repository<Visit> {
    List<Visit> getVisitByClient(String client);
    List<Visit> getVisitByPage(String page);
    List<Visit> getVisitByDatehour(LocalDateTime dateHour);
}
```

The second step is to create the interface and use it. Is that all? That is it! The idea of the Query Builder is to really make creating the persistence interface very simple. Here is how to create the instance of the class that actually implements this interface:

``` Java
UserDAO userDAO = QueryBuilder.create(UserDAO.class);
VisitDAO visitDAO = QueryBuilder.create(VisitDAO.class);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Esfinge Query Builder is an extensible framework and can be applied to several types of databases. Currently, it has extensions for JDBC, JPA, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4J.

Given all of this, let us return to the question: **Which page is most accessed by visitors over 30 years old?**

To address this question, we'll look at a common point that will act as a key between the bases. In line to the DDD methodology (Domain Driven Design), the primary entity is **User**, whereas **Visit** is a value object. In the example provided, the **Visit** **client field** has the value from the **User** **login field**. Using these fields, we can establish a correlation.

#### C1.1) Simple (Typical Solution)
The **simple** or typical approach to addressing the highlighted issue is to create a method in the controller class and use the two DAOs independently as demonstrated below:

``` Java
private static UserDAO userDAO;
private static VisitDAO visitDAO;

public MyController(){
    UserDAO dao = QueryBuilder.create(UserDAO.class);
    VisitDAO dao = QueryBuilder.create(VisitDAO.class);
}

public String getMostViewedPageByGreaterAge(int age) {

    Map<String, Integer> mostViewedPages = new HashMap();

    // use userDAO to retrieve users over 30 years old
    List<User> users = userDAO.getUserByGreaterAge(30);

    // iterate over the users and for each one retrieve user.getLogin()
        String loginValue = user.getLogin();

        // use visitDAO to retrieve visits with client equal to loginValue
        List<Visit> visits = visitDAO.getVisitByClient(loginValue);

        // iterate through the visits and for each one retrieve visit.getPage()
             String page = visit.getPage();

            // add page to mostViewedPages updating the value of how many times it appears
            // omitted code

    // return the page that was visited the most times from mostViewedPages
    // omitted code
}
```

#### C1.2) Polyglot Solution
A more intuitive method to solve this question from the perspective of a polyglot persistence API is to look at the two entities as correlated within the same domain, retrieving data exclusively from the principal entity's DAO. To do this, we must modify our **User** class as well as the controller class's **getMostViewedPageByGreaterAge** method.

In the User class, we will utilize annotations to notify the Esfinge Query Builder framework that we are employing polyglot features.

1. We changed the annotation from **@PersistenceType(value = JPA1)** to **@PersistenceType(value = JPA1, secondary = MONGODB)**. This informs the framework that a different database type, specifically MongoDB, is associated with one of the class attributes.
2. We create the **visits** attribute and mark it with JPA's **@Transient** to indicate it is not linked to the primary persistence type.
3. The **visits** attribute is annotated with the **@PolyglotOneToMany(referencedEntity = User.class)** annotation, indicating the primary entity as a reference.
4. We use the **@PolyglotJoin(name = "client", referencedAttributeName = "login")** annotation on the **visits** attribute to specify **client** ¬†attribute from the **Visit** class as the _name_, and the **login** (class attribute from class referenced in **@PolyglotOneToMany**)¬† as _referencedAttributeName_.
5. Done!

See the full class below:

``` Java
@Entity
@PersistenceType(value = JPA1, secondary = MONGODB)
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;
    private String name;
    private String lastName;
    private Strig login;
    private String password;
    private int age;

    @Transient
    @PolyglotOneToMany(referencedEntity = User.class)
    @PolyglotJoin(name = "client", referencedAttributeName = "login")
    private List<Visit> visits;

    // getters and setters
}
```

``` Java

private static UserDAO userDAO;

public MyController(){
    UserDAO dao = QueryBuilder.create(UserDAO.class);
}

public String getMostViewedPageByGreaterAge(int age) {

    Map<String, Integer> mostViewedPages = new HashMap();

    // use userDAO to retrieve users over 30 years old
    List<User> users = userDAO.getUserByGreaterAge(30);

    // iterate through the visits and for each one retrieve user.getVisits()

        // iterate through the user's visits and for each one retrieve visit.getPage()
             String page = visit.getPage();

            // add page to mostViewedPages updating the value of how many times it appears
            // omitted code

    // return the page that was visited the most times from mostViewedPages
    // omitted code
}
```

Notice how, in this solution, a unified API allowed the developer to access data from the same domain even in multiple databases in a completely transparent manner.

### C2) Documentation prerequisites

In section C1) of the example, you will learn everything needed to complete the tasks outlined in this experiment.

In this review, we covered the fundamentals of using Esfinge Query Builder and its polyglot annotations.
- @PersistenceType
- @PolyglotOneToMany
- @PolyglotJoin

Please review this document if necessary while carrying out the proposed tasks in the experiment.

## D) Procedure üë®‚Äçüè´ <sup>(for the supervisor)</sup>
Four tasks are provided: **Simple1A**, **Polyglot2A**, **Polyglot1B***, and **Simple2B**. It involves domains: 1 and 2, with the application of two techniques: simple and polyglot, solved by two groups: A and B.

This experiment employs a crossover methodology. To validate the methodology, the experiment must be executed as outlined below:

- Division of the volunteer cohort into two groups: **A** and **B**;
- Group **A** will perform the tasks **Simple1A** and **Polyglot2A** in that order;
- Group **B** will perform the tasks **Polyglot1B** and **Simple2B** in that order.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The division into groups and the sequence of task execution is essential.
> 
> Additionally, please take into account a time interval between the execution of tasks, if feasible.
>
> After completing all tasks, the volunteer must respond to the questionnaire.
